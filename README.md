# Python Lightcycle (from Disney's 1983 film TRON)

This is a little Lightcycle clone I made, with PvP and PvC.

I included sound effects from the movie for the bikes. There is also a file "TRON repeatable 1.wav" that would play in the main menu, but I gitignored it for copyright reasons. It was cut from _A New Tron and the MCP_ OST from about 1:15 to 1:50 if you want to recreate it legally.

## Dependencies:

This program depends on the following non-native Python libraries, which can be installed with Pip:
- [PyGame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

## Usage:

Install Python 3 and the dependencies, then run the lightcycle.pyw program.

- Gold player uses WASD.
- Blue player uses arrow keys.
- Press Esc at any time to exit.
- Press any other key after a game to return to title screen.

Enjoy! S.D.G.
